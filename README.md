# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification – Logistic Regression Project

Welcome to my machine learning mini-project! In this notebook, I classify Iris flower species using one of the most beginner-friendly ML algorithms — **Logistic Regression**. This project demonstrates the **complete machine learning pipeline** using a classic dataset and helps me build a strong foundation in AI/ML.

## 📁 Project Overview

This project includes:
- End-to-end ML pipeline: data loading → preprocessing → training → testing → evaluation → visualization
- Implementation of Logistic Regression using Scikit-learn
- Beautiful visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Evaluation through accuracy and confusion matrix

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Classify iris flowers into one of **three species**:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

Based on four numeric features:
1. Sepal length (cm)
2. Sepal width (cm)
3. Petal length (cm)
4. Petal width (cm)

- **Name**: Iris Dataset
- **Source**: Scikit-learn library (originally from UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- **Samples**: 150 total
- **Classes**: 3 (50 samples per class)
- **Type**: Multiclass Classification
